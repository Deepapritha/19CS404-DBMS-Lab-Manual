# Experiment 5: Subqueries and Views

## AIM
To study and implement subqueries and views.

## THEORY

### Subqueries
A subquery is a query inside another SQL query and is embedded in:
- WHERE clause
- HAVING clause
- FROM clause

**Types:**
- **Single-row subquery**:
  Sub queries can also return more than one value. Such results should be made use along with the operators in and any.
- **Multiple-row subquery**:
  Here more than one subquery is used. These multiple sub queries are combined by means of ‘and’ & ‘or’ keywords.
- **Correlated subquery**:
  A subquery is evaluated once for the entire parent statement whereas a correlated Sub query is evaluated once per row processed by the parent statement.

**Example:**
```sql
SELECT * FROM employees
WHERE salary > (SELECT AVG(salary) FROM employees);
```
### Views
A view is a virtual table based on the result of an SQL SELECT query.
**Create View:**
```sql
CREATE VIEW view_name AS
SELECT column1, column2 FROM table_name WHERE condition;
```
**Drop View:**
```sql
DROP VIEW view_name;
```

**Question 1**
Write a SQL query to Retrieve the names of customers who have a phone number that is not shared with any other customer.

SAMPLE TABLE: customer

name             type
---------------  ---------------
id               INTEGER
name             TEXT
city             TEXT
email            TEXT
phone            INTEGER
**Program**
```
SELECT name
FROM customer
WHERE phone IN(
    SELECT phone
    FROM customer
    GROUP BY phone
    HAVING COUNT(phone)=1
);
```

**Question 2**
From the following tables write a SQL query to find all orders generated by London-based salespeople. Return ord_no, purch_amt, ord_date, customer_id, salesman_id.

salesman table

name             type
---------------  ---------------
salesman_id      numeric(5)
name                 varchar(30)
city                    varchar(15)
commission       decimal(5,2)

orders table

name             type
---------------  --------
order_no         int
purch_amt        real
order_date       text
customer_id      int
salesman_id      int
**Program**
```
SELECT o.ord_no, o.purch_amt, o.ord_date,o.customer_id, o.salesman_id
FROM orders o
JOIN salesman s ON o.salesman_id=s.salesman_id
where s.city='London';
```

**Question 3**
---
Write a SQL query to retrieve all columns from the CUSTOMERS table for customers whose salary is greater than $4500.

Sample table: CUSTOMERS

ID          NAME        AGE         ADDRESS     SALARY
----------  ----------  ----------  ----------  ----------

1          Ramesh     32              Ahmedabad     2000
2          Khilan        25              Delhi                 1500
3          Kaushik      23              Kota                  2000
4          Chaitali       25             Mumbai            6500
5          Hardik        27              Bhopal              8500
6          Komal         22              Hyderabad       4500

7           Muffy          24              Indore            10000

**Program**
```
SELECT *
FROM CUSTOMERS
WHERE SALARY>4500;
```

**Output:**
